### Categorization and ML with OpenAI Embeddings 

Project description: Given data on every app and website a user clicked on during the work day, as well as their calendar, can you predict their productivity and task completion? That is the goal of this project, which can roughly be divided into two parts: categorization of apps/websites and prediction of user productivity. See the READ.ME for more.

### HVAC Demand Response Cycling Model

Project description: During a Demand Response (DR) event, enrolled buildings must cut their total energy usage over a requested amount of time (the DR event length) by a predetermined amount (the nominated load). In order to accurately calculate the nominated load for a given building, I implemented a model which simulates a building undergoing a DR event by taking into account the interactions between HVAC units, building zones, ambient climate conditions, and a predetermined DR HVAC cycling strategy.

### Honors Econometrics Final Project - Diff in Diff Analysis of 

Project description: Government agencies and private foundations distribute billions of dollars in financial aid to college-goers each year, in the hopes of boosting educational attainment. Tennessee, for example, guarantees no-cost tuition for all high school graduates at in-state community and technical colleges. In this report, I investigate the potential impact of this state-run program on Tennessee college enrollment using a diff-in-diff analysis of Tennessee state education datasets.
