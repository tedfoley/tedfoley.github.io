## HVAC Demand Response Cycling Model

**Project description:** During a Demand Response (DR) event, enrolled buildings must cut their total energy usage over a requested amount of time (the DR event length) by a predetermined amount (the nominated load). In order to accurately calculate the nominated load for a given building, I implemented a model which simulates a building undergoing a DR event by taking into account the interactions between HVAC units, building zones, ambient climate conditions, and a predetermined DR HVAC cycling strategy.
